                <p>The 2015-16 season was Leicester City's 111th season in the English football league system and their 48th (non-consecutive) season in the top tier of English football.
                    During the season, Leicester participated in the Premier League for the second consecutive season, as well as the FA Cup and League Cup. 
                    In what was described as one of the greatest sporting stories of all time, Leicester were confirmed as champions of the 2015-16 Premier League season on 2 May 2016, 
                    finishing top of England's highest league for the first time in the club's history. The club was 5000-1 with bookmakers to win the division before the season kicked off.
                    The feat meant that Leicester would be playing in the UEFA Champions League the following season, a first for the club in their history. 
                    The season also saw history be made for individual players within the team, as striker Jamie Vardy broke the record for consecutive games with a goal in the Premier League (11) 
                    and winger Riyad Mahrez became the first African and first Algerian player to be the recipient of the PFA Players' Player of the Year.

                <p>
                    On 13 July 2015, Leicester City announced Ranieri as the club's new manager on a three-year contract.
                    Ranieri's managerial debut with the club came in a 4-2 win over Sunderland on the opening match of the season on 8 August.
                    The strong start of the season saw the club at the top of the Premier League at Christmas, having scored in each of their first 17 games.
                    During this run, striker Jamie Vardy broke the Premier League record by scoring in 11 consecutive league matches, a run Ranieri compared to Gabriel Batistuta's during the 1994-95 season, while Ranieri was his manager at Fiorentina.
                    <br>
                    Leicester entered April at the summit of the Premier League and on 10 April 2016, they clinched a spot in the 2016-17 Champions League after a 2-0 away win over Sunderland
                    Leicester City clinched the Premier League title the following day after second-place club Tottenham could only manage a 2-2 draw against Chelsea, despite leading 2-0 at half-time. 
                    This was the first time the club had won the title in their 132-year history. The team's success was described as a "fairytale" and the "most unlikely triumph in the history of team sport"
